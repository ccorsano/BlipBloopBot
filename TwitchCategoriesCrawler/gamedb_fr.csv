While the games feature several expansions in key areas, the overall plot follows the same direction as the original Gold and Silver. Some aspects exclusive to Crystal are also included. Like how FireRed and LeafGreen could link up with Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald to complete the Pokédex by trading regionally exclusive Pokémon, HeartGold and SoulSilver can link up with Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum to obtain Pokémon unavailable in Johto and Kanto (such as the Sinnoh starters) and vice versa. 
Kris, despite being the female counterpart of Crystal's player character, is not included as the female player character, with a new character instead taking her place. Whether she is chosen to be the player character or not, this new character will still appear in the game. The unselected protagonist will take a pseudo-rival role similar to the unselected characters of Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. 
The games were released on September 12, 2009 in Japan, February 4, 2010 in Korea, March 14, 2010 in North America, March 25, 2010 in Australia and March 26, 2010 in Europe (this excludes the Netherlands, Luxembourg and parts of Belgium due to an in-game save error, with the patched copies later released on April 2, 2010).",,1558

From a third-person perspective, players control Jodie through fully interactive environments, choosing a variety of action-, dialogue-, and decision-paths based on on-screen prompts. Some choices can lead to depictions of violence: Jodie attacking assailants with punches, kicks, and various objects (e.g., tree branches and knives; impaling an enemy with a pipe). As the character Aiden, players solve puzzles, manipulate objects and attack (e.g., strangulation) Jodie's assailants. Players can also use Aiden to possess enemies and perform violent acts (e.g., shooting fellow SWAT members; crashing vehicles; performing self-inflicted gunshot wounds). Some of these sequences are accompanied by blood-splatter effects. In one cutscene, a bound character's eye is cut out during an interrogation—the act is obscured by a character's back. One prolonged bar sequence depicts three men attempting to rape a woman; players control Aiden and interact with objects to stop the assailants. Another sequence depicts a character propositioning a woman to perform fellatio. The game includes depictions of the central character drinking beer and smoking a marijuana in a party setting – screen distortion occurs during theses sequences.

The game tells the story of the Blackwood estate on the outskirts of Rothbury, a small rural town in Northumberland, England in 1976.

Originally owned by James T. Blackwood in 1963, the house is passed to Christopher Milton after Mr. Blackwood is accused of murdering his wife. A couple of days later, Mr. Blackwood dies of a sudden heart attack though some in the town start rumors that he might have committed suicide. The police decide to close the case seeing there is no further evidence left. Shortly after acquiring the house, Milton inexplicably disappears in 1970 leaving no visible trace.

The player assumes the role of the house's next inhabitant, Michael Arthate, an author seeking seclusion to work on his next book. He moves in only to find that the house still echoes its horrible past quite literally as scratches are heard all around, particularly in the basement and fireplaces, and soon becomes more interested in researching the house's history than his writing.

Scratches uses a first person perspective to navigate around the house. Using only a mouse, the player can access various rooms and other places in order to solve the mystery of both Blackwood and Milton's disappearances. It features music and special sound effects by the now defunct Cellar of Rats, which contribute to the fearsome ambience experienced at the mansion, crypt, greenhouse and church.

The game is heavily influenced by the H.P. Lovecraft mythos and several direct references to Lovecraft works make their appearances in Scratches. There are in-game references to the Necronomicon, De Vermis Mysteriis, Lovecraft's story ""The Mountains of Madness,"" as well as one critics of Michael's book being called R'yleh. Michael states in the game he had just moved to Rothbury from Providence, Rhode Island-the hometown of Lovecraft.",,11836

Krystal is looking for answers to the destruction of her home planet, and the murder of her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace after receiving a distress call from Dinosaur Planet, but an unfortunate event occurs during her exploration of this location. 
 
Meanwhile, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team and asks them to investigate Dinosaur Planet. One of the main reasons for the investigation, is that large chunks of the planet have become detached for an unexplained reason. 
 
Fox McCloud agrees to take a look. On the planet's surface, Fox comes across a magical staff that becomes his sole weapon in the game. 
 
Fox learns from the Triceratops Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that General Scales, a member of a different tribe, has stolen the four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples, causing the detachment of parts of the planet.

It still keeps the complex story, character level-up and customization though. The game features main characters from the other Final Fantasy titles, two from each title (the protagonist and the antagonist). The plot revolves around the battle of the two gods, Cosmos and Chaos. The protagonists will form teams in order to fight through Chaos' armies and find their crystals which will later be used to destroy Chaos. Each character has his own campaign to go through at the end of which a crystal will be collected. 
 
The game also features a single fight and an arcade mode where the player will be able to choose his fighter and the opponent (opponents are automatically chosen by the game if playing in arcade mode though). All of the character's experience and skills received through the campaign are saved for the other game modes (and vice-versa, for example: if Cloud had a level equal to 12 when completing the campaign, he will also appear to have the same level when viewing him in the character roster in Arcade or Quick Battle mode). 
 
Another feature is that the items you find during the campaign belong to you, the player. That means you can move items from a character to another. The game also features extra content such as villains, costumes etc. which can be unlocked by using PP. You get such points from each fight and completed campaign.",,24400

The game gave significant focus on plot and characterization, with extensive usage of cinematics and voice acting.

The regular gameplay features a third person perspective, where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally. Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and turn into a morph ball, which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game's environments are three-dimensional and movement is not limited to a two-dimensional plane. Other M is the first in the series to feature a melee combat system. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point-blank range.

When the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches to a first-person view, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.",,1113

Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back. 
Halo 3 introduces ""support weapons"", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares.
