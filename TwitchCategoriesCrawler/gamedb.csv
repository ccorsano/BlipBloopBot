505257,,Enlisted,,"Enlisted is a squad-based first person MMO shooter covering key battles from World War II. The game carefully recreates weapons, military vehicles and the atmosphere of that era, while demonstrating really massive clashes of numerous soldiers, tanks and aircraft with artillery and naval support.  
 
Most of the Enlisted game modes simulate a battle involving several infantry platoons and gives the player control over a squad of soldiers with various roles (i.e. submachine gun soldier, sniper, radio operator, rifleman and others), a whole military vehicle crew or an aircraft pilot. One of the fighters is controlled directly, while others move and shoot independently following the player's general orders. In a situation where all the soldiers in the squad have fallen, a player respawns with the next available squad. This decision makes Enlisted battles look massive and spectacular while keeping the input of each individual player in the overall team victory quite significant.  
 
Enlisted is developed by Darkflow Software studio using Dagor engine - the same engine that is used by Gaijin Entertainment’s War Thunder military online action game. That’s why the accurately recreated ground vehicles and aircraft look, move and are controlled in the most realistic way and their damage model is quite sophisticated. For example, when a shell breaks through a tank armor, the trajectory of individual shards is properly calculated as well as the exact consequences to each vehicle part and crew member.  
 
Features: 
 
– Epic massive battles that look as massive as the historical battles, like the Omaha beach landing.  
 
– High input of each player in the team victory: Despite the massiveness of the battles, the result is significantly defined by the performance of each player. 
 
– The diversity of game roles and the ability to switch between them on the fly: one minute you’re storming enemy trenches with a submachine gun, the next, you’re hiding on a roof with a sniper rifle, and you can also jump into a tank to break through the defenses, throw grenades towards the enemy vehicle or provide air support to your teammates. 
 
– Enlisted looks authentic even in the tiniest details, like the appearance of soldiers and buildings or a tank’s damage model. The list of vehicles and weapons available in specific missions is also based on real history, so you cannot use equipment from 1945 in a battle that took place in 1941.  
 
– A player can customize and train squads according to their individual playing style, unlock perks and upgrades as long as this does not contradict the historical accuracy principle.",,26431,

Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generously—and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains in your pool of hunters—called your Bloodline—always. 
 
Hunt’s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each match, up to five teams of two set out to track their monstrous targets. Once they’ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty—and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you don’t watch your back, you’ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of another team of Hunters walking away with your prize. The higher the risk, the higher the reward–but a single mistake could cost you everything. 
 
PROGRESSION: Even in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die, you lose everything but your experience. 
 
DARK SIGHT: Dark Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target. Dark Sight also marks players carrying a bounty, making them more vulnerable to ambush while trying to escape.",,7291,594650

Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a real-time strategy video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. Released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh, it is the second game in the Age of Empires series. The Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages and contains thirteen playable civilizations. Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are five historically based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions. There are three additional single-player game modes, and multiplayer is supported. 
 
Despite using the same game engine and similar code to its predecessor, development of The Age of Kings took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in Age of Empires, but noted on release that some problems remained. A Sega Dreamcast version was announced, but cancelled for unknown reasons. An updated high-definition graphics version of the game, Age of Empires II: HD Edition, was released in 2013. The HD Edition includes the original game and the expansion The Conquerors, as well as new campaigns, civilizations, and updated graphics for high-resolution displays. Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, a remaster, was released in November 2019.",,327,

While players can only explore with four heroes, they will be able to recruit and manage around a dozen heroes from the local tavern or caravan. The heroes are recruited from 15 different classes each class with its own unique skills and abilities. 
 
Combat occurs in narrow passages which means the party's order is important in respect to the heroes' class and the player's strategy. As an example, a crusader is a good front unit having both high attack and defense values while the plague doctor might be better further behind throwing plague bombs to spread disease and confusion. 
 
Instead of leveling, heroes have ""resolve"" which will increase as they adventure. Fighting and events will test the hero's resolve and they might develop afflictions if they fail their resolve. This can turn out both positively and negatively creating different set of afflictions for every hero. 
 
While exploring the dungeons, the light of the heroes torch becomes dimmer, which means the dungeons gets more dangerous but yields better loot as well. The heroes have to camp to replenish the torch in the dungeons. Red Hook refers to this as tactical camping because players have to distribute rations among their heroes, protect the camp from ambushes, and reduce the stress levels of the heroes, all costing actions points",,8965,262060

The train tracks circulate those dispensers as they keep filling the inner field around them with balls. Matching 3 or more balls of the same color makes them disappear. If the spheres accumulate, a floating time bomb appears. Its detonation ends the game. 
 
Special balls with symbols are thrown randomly on the field. They act as a power-up when matched. Nuke balls explode surrounding balls. Haste balls temporally increase the train speed. Color bomb balls pop all spheres of the same color on the field. Time balls temporally stop the dispensers. 
 
A hollow pole with a factory whistle at the left-side of the screen slowly fills with each match. Matching spheres also gives extra ammunition for the weapons. The level ends when the bar is complete and the whistle blown. 
 
The train movement is controlled by the keyboard and the cannon aiming and shooting by the mouse. Some levels have gates, balls or enemies on the tracks, stopping the train movement. Other levels have pinball slider tracks and bouncer springs. 
 
Enemies throw bombs that stop the train or the cannon from working. Most can be killed with one of the weapons, although some have to be color matched with a ball to be destroyed. 
 
The weapons can be selected with the mouse wheel or pressing a number key. Besides the default ball-shooting cannon, there is a weapon with homing bees that wait for an enemy came out from hiding to attack it.

494030,,Girls' Frontline,,"Girls' Frontline is a moe anthropomorphism game in which the player controls echelons of android characters, known in-game as ""T-Dolls"" or ""Tactical Dolls"", each of which represents a real-world firearm. 
 The player plays as a newly recruited commander of an area who commands the T-Dolls in battle, and organises the echelons as well as the T-Dolls' wellbeing. Battles are a mix of turn-based strategy puzzles on a set map with enemies that can move about, random item nodes and heliports/command nodes, from which the player can summon their own echelons, or support echelons, which are echelons that the player's friend sets on their profile to be used by others, and real-time battles with enemy echelons. Battles are for the most part automated, although the player can activate the T-Dolls' special abilities manually if wanted, or order them to different spots in formation (which the player can organise out of battle to be set as the default formation when entering a battle) or to withdraw in order to conserve health or resources). Players also have the option of withdrawing specific echelons from the mission altogether if they wish. Gameplay progresses by playing on the campaign missions, logistic support missions, or combat simulations to level up each T-Doll. The game also features gacha elements, such as in the production and heavy production of T-Dolls and equipment, or in the Dormitory with costumes and furniture sets for the T-Dolls on a time-limited basis with several sets and costumes being available for a limited time, before another few sets and costumes are revealed and added. After a while, old costumes from previous gacha events will be added to the ""Black Card"" store, where players can exchange an amount of Black Cards (obtained from gifting T-Dolls a duplicate costume that has already been gifted before) for a costume of a previous gacha set. Players can customise their dorms with furniture, and interact with Chibi renditions of the T-Dolls in the echelon corresponding with that dorm. They can also gift the T-Dolls food and costume, which raises the affection of the T-Dolls. Affection is also gained from success in battle, and is lost when the T-Dolls die (unless it is a boss battle) or when another T-Doll in the same echelon dies.",,58075,

Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a real-time strategy video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. Released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh, it is the second game in the Age of Empires series. The Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages and contains thirteen playable civilizations. Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are five historically based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions. There are three additional single-player game modes, and multiplayer is supported. 
 
Despite using the same game engine and similar code to its predecessor, development of The Age of Kings took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in Age of Empires, but noted on release that some problems remained. A Sega Dreamcast version was announced, but cancelled for unknown reasons. An updated high-definition graphics version of the game, Age of Empires II: HD Edition, was released in 2013. The HD Edition includes the original game and the expansion The Conquerors, as well as new campaigns, civilizations, and updated graphics for high-resolution displays.

Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generously—and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains in your pool of hunters—called your Bloodline—always. 
 
Hunt’s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each match, up to five teams of two set out to track their monstrous targets. Once they’ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty—and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you don’t watch your back, you’ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of another team of Hunters walking away with your prize. The higher the risk, the higher the reward–but a single mistake could cost you everything. 
 
PROGRESSION: Even in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die, you lose everything but your experience. 
 
DARK SIGHT: Dark Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target.

Its ports to several computer and console systems followed in 1999-2000. It is the third installment of the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The player can choose to play through seven different campaigns telling the story, or play in a scenario against computer or human opponents.
The gameplay is very similar to its predecessors in that the player controls a number of heroes that command an army of creatures inspired by myth and legend.

The hero will progress in experience by engaging in combat with enemy heroes and monsters. The conditions for victory vary depending on the map, including conquest of all enemies and towns, collection of a certain amount of a resource, or finding the grail artifact.",,364,

505257,,Enlisted,,"Enlisted is a squad-based first person MMO shooter covering key battles from World War II. The game carefully recreates weapons, military vehicles and the atmosphere of that era, while demonstrating really massive clashes of numerous soldiers, tanks and aircraft with artillery and naval support.  
 
Most of the Enlisted game modes simulate a battle involving several infantry platoons and gives the player control over a squad of soldiers with various roles (i.e. submachine gun soldier, sniper, radio operator, rifleman and others), a whole military vehicle crew or an aircraft pilot. One of the fighters is controlled directly, while others move and shoot independently following the player's general orders. In a situation where all the soldiers in the squad have fallen, a player respawns with the next available squad. This decision makes Enlisted battles look massive and spectacular while keeping the input of each individual player in the overall team victory quite significant.  
 
Enlisted is developed by Darkflow Software studio using Dagor engine - the same engine that is used by Gaijin Entertainment’s War Thunder military online action game. That’s why the accurately recreated ground vehicles and aircraft look, move and are controlled in the most realistic way and their damage model is quite sophisticated. For example, when a shell breaks through a tank armor, the trajectory of individual shards is properly calculated as well as the exact consequences to each vehicle part and crew member.  
 
Features: 
 
– Epic massive battles that look as massive as the historical battles, like the Omaha beach landing.  
 
– High input of each player in the team victory: Despite the massiveness of the battles, the result is significantly defined by the performance of each player. 
 
– The diversity of game roles and the ability to switch between them on the fly: one minute you’re storming enemy trenches with a submachine gun, the next, you’re hiding on a roof with a sniper rifle, and you can also jump into a tank to break through the defenses, throw grenades towards the enemy vehicle or provide air support to your teammates. 
 
– Enlisted looks authentic even in the tiniest details, like the appearance of soldiers and buildings or a tank’s damage model. The list of vehicles and weapons available in specific missions is also based on real history, so you cannot use equipment from 1945 in a battle that took place in 1941.  
 
– A player can customize and train squads according to their individual playing style, unlock perks and upgrades as long as this does not contradict the historical accuracy principle.",,26431,

The heroes are recruited from 15 different classes each class with its own unique skills and abilities. 
 
Combat occurs in narrow passages which means the party's order is important in respect to the heroes' class and the player's strategy. As an example, a crusader is a good front unit having both high attack and defense values while the plague doctor might be better further behind throwing plague bombs to spread disease and confusion. 
 
Instead of leveling, heroes have ""resolve"" which will increase as they adventure. Fighting and events will test the hero's resolve and they might develop afflictions if they fail their resolve. This can turn out both positively and negatively creating different set of afflictions for every hero. 
 
While exploring the dungeons, the light of the heroes torch becomes dimmer, which means the dungeons gets more dangerous but yields better loot as well. The heroes have to camp to replenish the torch in the dungeons. Red Hook refers to this as tactical camping because players have to distribute rations among their heroes, protect the camp from ambushes, and reduce the stress levels of the heroes, all costing actions points",,8965,262060

 The player plays as a newly recruited commander of an area who commands the T-Dolls in battle, and organises the echelons as well as the T-Dolls' wellbeing. Battles are a mix of turn-based strategy puzzles on a set map with enemies that can move about, random item nodes and heliports/command nodes, from which the player can summon their own echelons, or support echelons, which are echelons that the player's friend sets on their profile to be used by others, and real-time battles with enemy echelons. Battles are for the most part automated, although the player can activate the T-Dolls' special abilities manually if wanted, or order them to different spots in formation (which the player can organise out of battle to be set as the default formation when entering a battle) or to withdraw in order to conserve health or resources). Players also have the option of withdrawing specific echelons from the mission altogether if they wish. Gameplay progresses by playing on the campaign missions, logistic support missions, or combat simulations to level up each T-Doll. The game also features gacha elements, such as in the production and heavy production of T-Dolls and equipment, or in the Dormitory with costumes and furniture sets for the T-Dolls on a time-limited basis with several sets and costumes being available for a limited time, before another few sets and costumes are revealed and added. After a while, old costumes from previous gacha events will be added to the ""Black Card"" store, where players can exchange an amount of Black Cards (obtained from gifting T-Dolls a duplicate costume that has already been gifted before) for a costume of a previous gacha set. Players can customise their dorms with furniture, and interact with Chibi renditions of the T-Dolls in the echelon corresponding with that dorm. They can also gift the T-Dolls food and costume, which raises the affection of the T-Dolls. Affection is also gained from success in battle, and is lost when the T-Dolls die (unless it is a boss battle) or when another T-Doll in the same echelon dies.",,58075,

The player controls Tisha, a little girl riding a steampunk locomotive shooting colored balls from a mounted cannon at ball dispensers (in the first levels they are mole mounds). The train tracks circulate those dispensers as they keep filling the inner field around them with balls. Matching 3 or more balls of the same color makes them disappear. If the spheres accumulate, a floating time bomb appears. Its detonation ends the game. 
 
Special balls with symbols are thrown randomly on the field. They act as a power-up when matched. Nuke balls explode surrounding balls. Haste balls temporally increase the train speed. Color bomb balls pop all spheres of the same color on the field. Time balls temporally stop the dispensers. 
 
A hollow pole with a factory whistle at the left-side of the screen slowly fills with each match. Matching spheres also gives extra ammunition for the weapons. The level ends when the bar is complete and the whistle blown. 
 
The train movement is controlled by the keyboard and the cannon aiming and shooting by the mouse. Some levels have gates, balls or enemies on the tracks, stopping the train movement. Other levels have pinball slider tracks and bouncer springs. 
 
Enemies throw bombs that stop the train or the cannon from working. Most can be killed with one of the weapons, although some have to be color matched with a ball to be destroyed. 
 
The weapons can be selected with the mouse wheel or pressing a number key. Besides the default ball-shooting cannon, there is a weapon with homing bees that wait for an enemy came out from hiding to attack it. The gun shoots a bullet that pops balls and kills vulnerable enemies. The laser cannon shoots a beam that destroys everything in its path. Tisha also can throw herself on balls and enemies, eliminating both in a kamikaze attack.",,95441,

In a disorganized and ghostly city, those foolish, desperate, or unlucky enough to walk the streets lay prey to Britain’s most elusive predators: the vampires. Emerging from the chaos, a tormented figure awakens. You are Jonathan E. Reid, a high-ranking military surgeon transformed into a vampire upon his return home from the frontline. 
 
Explore the darkly atmospheric streets of early 20th century London, and interact with a multitude of characters with their own identities and importance. Accept and fulfill the missions they give you, but don’t forget: sooner or later, you will have to feed, and make a difficult choice... who will be your prey? Absolutely all characters in the game are potential victims of your vampiric lust. Carefully study the habits of your next victim, his or her relationships with other characters, and set up your strategy to feed, unnoticed: seduce them, change their daily habits, or make sure they end up alone in a dark street... 
 
Be careful who you choose to hunt, as they will be gone forever, and their death will impact in a meaningful way the world that surrounds you. Feeding on human blood will not just keep you ""alive""; it will also unlock new vampiric powers to use. 
 
There will be times when exploration and seduction will only get you so far, and you'll need to resort to engaging in Vampyr's dynamic real-time combat. It blends hard-hitting melee combat with ranged shooting mechanics and the supernatural vampire powers. You'll face many types of enemies: different species of vampires and creatures, as well as vampire hunters who want to hunt you down with their weapons, tools and traps. In Vampyr, your health and the ""energy"" that drives your supernatural powers are one and same! Using powers will drain your own blood, giving you an edge in battle but also leaving you weaker. You will have to find a way to feed during combat to replenish your strength.

Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill.

The game-adaption of the world-bestseller ""The Pillars of the Earth"" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei Lübbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format.

67637,,Until Dawn,,"Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror video game. It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive. 
 
Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game. 
 
The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. 
 
Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.",,7609,

It begins when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King counters and slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans. 
 
After vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King, the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which confuses King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his ""brainwashing level"" and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King. 
 
Mega and Bass begin a final confrontation with Dr. Wily in his newly-regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities because of his past failures in challenging Mega Man. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes for them to be friends if they were meet in the future.",,1726,

The game tells the story of our future, after brain-computer interfacing technology has become highly advanced and human civilization has experienced another evolutionary leap, during which, great events have begun to unfold. Justice faces off against evil. The old stands against the new. And forces of conservatism clash with radicalism. 
In this virtual world, all our heroes and heroines have acquired a “super power” through the help of quantum droids – the ability to turn quantum cube energy into any tactical support device they need. From Optical Camouflage to Quantum Barriers, from a detector that alerts you of approaching enemies, to a medical instrument that heals squad mates; anything and everything can be built, by you, and that's not all. You can choose whatever skills you think will help your strategy the most in any battle. 
We've even created a vertical combat concept. With parkour features including climbing, gliding, and rolling, players can experience vertical battles on a variety of terrain, including mountains, swamps and deserts. In this game, the arena that hosts your battles are not just a huge, flat map, but a world where you can fly in the sky and move underground. We have also created a number of exploration points scattered throughout the world. Here, you can explore temples in the desert with a chance of finding E-Cores to unlock new skills and weapons. Amid mounds of destroyed robots, you can also find gloves that greatly increase your climbing speed.",,117145,
